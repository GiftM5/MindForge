🧠 Vision & Manifesto
"Think first. Forge ahead."

MindForge exists to revive and protect human creativity and critical thinking in an AI-powered world.

🔹 We believe AI should support, not replace, the human mind.
🔹 We believe challenges help us grow.
🔹 We believe that asking, “What have I tried first?” is a superpower.

The Mission:
Help learners, coders, and creatives train their brains before turning to AI — by rewarding effort, reflection, and progress.
