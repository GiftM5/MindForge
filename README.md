# 🧠 MindForge

**Think first. Then use AI.**

MindForge is a productivity and creativity tool designed for thinkers, learners, coders, and creators who want to strengthen their independent thinking before leaning on AI.

## 🌟 Why MindForge?

In a world where AI gives us answers instantly, it's easy to forget the power of our own minds. **MindForge helps you build mental muscle first** by encouraging you to reflect, write, and reason *before* accessing AI suggestions.

> 🚀 **Forge your mind before feeding it answers.**

## 💡 What Can You Do With MindForge?

### ✍️ 1. Smart Prompt System  
Write your thoughts, plans, or code ideas then get *smart*, context-aware prompts that enhance or expand your thinking.

### 🧠 2. Deep Work Journal  
A space for you to brainstorm, struggle, reflect, and grow. Perfect for journaling ideas, experiments, and mental models.

### 💬 3. AI with Purpose  
No more instant “answers”. Instead, you decide when and how to ask for help. AI responses come after your input making them richer, more aligned, and educational.

### 📈 4. Mind Growth Tracker *(Coming Soon)*  
Track your learning moments, creativity bursts, and how often you solved things before asking AI.
